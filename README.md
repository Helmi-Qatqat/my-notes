## About me
I am an Electrical Power Engineer, fresh graduate from Al Balqa Applied University – Faculty of Engineering Technology. Held a position of Media and Academic Committees in Power and Communication Engineers Student Union known as ‘PCE Team’.

## What I have learned in today’s lecture:

### a. Git & Github
- Learned about ACP (add commit push).
- How to get SSH key.
- Why It is not best practice to edit on github.
- How to create a new directory and view listed files.

### b. How to become a better developer (article)

Every developer seeks to be able to build any software asked from him in a short time period, but unfortunately most of them fall into many traps that will cause them to write complex codes or missing the deadlines.
So here are some pieces of advice to help you being a good software developer:
1.	When you are working on a project make sure that you understand the whole thing and know the tools that you should be using.
2.	Intelligence is not writing a complex code; it is making the code simple and readable.
3.	Do not look at the problem as a whole, it will make you scared, instead divide the problem into parts and solve each one.
4.	Do not underestimate the time the task needs.
5.	Do not be a hero, ask for help and advice when you feel like you need one and tried everything possible.
6.	Build the software based on what it needs not what it might need in the future.

When applying these things in your development, it will be easier for you to code, and always remember to never stop learning new things and keep searching.
